Basic Portfolio

This is the very first homework assignment for my first coding bootcamp. This is fully an expression of what I have learned in the first week of this class considering that I have never coded anything prior to the pre-work assignments. This three page portfolio website shows some information about me, has a contact form template, links to my social media as well as some projects I have done and photos that I have taken. This webpage uses html for the structure and css for stylization.
