				File me under Nuube... but you know what, its ON now! I'm just going to get faster, my code will just get tighter, my style will seep through. How sweet is it for you to be here to witness the start? Pretty lucky I'd say.

			<p>
				I'm someone with many interests. Working as the director of cultivation for a large indoor cultivation center, my days are spent solving unique problems with variables that vary widely from day to day. From nutrient deficiencies, to integrated pest management, or touring investors and settling employee conflict. It keeps me busy.

			<p>
				Spending time in the mountains is important to me. Rock climbing is my sport, along with skateboarding and skiing, always making sure to keep the camera nearby to snap a shot or two...thousand.
